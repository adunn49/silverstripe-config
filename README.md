The aim of this is to implement the SilverStripe config system in a way that can be
understood by many and to improve performance whilst keeping the powerful features.

## Manifesto

### Simplicity over Complexity

We will strive to simplyfy the code and document its features and concepts at every level 
making it easier for others to understand and contribute.

### Performance over Features

This package aims to improve on performance and where appropriate change, remove or
disable features which prevent a performant solution. We aim to promote better PHP
architecture through the prioritisation of performance over feature.
